<title>Input and output</title>
<para>Gappa reads a script on its standard input. Such a script is made of
three parts: the definitions, the logical formula, and the hints. Warning
messages, error messages, and results are displayed on the standard error
output. Gappa send to the standard output a formal proof of the logical
formula; its format depends on the selected back-end.</para>

<section>
<title>Selecting a back-end</title>

<para>These options are mutually exclusive and cannot be embedded into the
scripts.</para>

<para>Option: <code>-Bnull</code>. Do not enable any back-end. This is the
default. This is also the only back-end compatible with the
<code>-Munconstrained</code> option.</para>

<para>Option: <code>-Bcoq</code>. When this back-end is selected, Gappa will
generate a proof script of its results and this script can be automatically
machine-checked by the Coq proof-checker.</para>

<title>Setting internal parameters</title>

<section>
<title>Internal precision</title>
<para>Option: <code>-Eprecision=</code><emphasis>integer</emphasis></para>
<para>This option sets the internal MPFR precision used by the bounds of the
intervals. The default value is 60. This is already a high value, any use of
a higher setting would probably be dubious.</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Dichotomy depth</title>
<para>Option: <code>-Edichotomy=</code><emphasis>integer</emphasis></para>
<para>This option limits the depth of a dichotomy split. The default value is
100. It means that an interval of width 1 will potentially be split in
2^100 intervals of width 2^-100.</para>

<title>Enabling and disabling warning messages</title>
<para>By default, all the warning messages are enabled. See annex for the
detail of the warning types.</para>

<section>
<title>Embedded options</title>
<para>Options setting internal parameters or enabling warning messages can be
embedded in a Gappa proof script. It is especially important when the logical
property cannot be proved with the default parameters. These options are passed
through a special comment syntax: <code>#@ -Edichotomy=200</code>.</para>
