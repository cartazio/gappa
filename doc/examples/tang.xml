<title>The algorithm</title>

<para>In <emphasis>Table-Driven Implementation of the Exponential Function
in IEEE Floating-Point Arithmetic</emphasis>, Ping Tak Peter Tang described
an implementation of an almost correctly-rounded elementary function in
single and double precision. John Harrison later did a complete formal proof
in HOL Light of the implementation in <emphasis>Floating point verification
in HOL Light: the exponential function</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Here we just focus on the tedious computation of the rounding error. We
consider neither the argument reduction nor the reconstruction part (trivial
anyway, excepted when the end result is subnormal). We want to prove that, in
the C code below, the absolute error between <code>e</code> and the exponential
<code>E0</code> of <code>R0</code> (the ideal reduced argument) is less than
0.54 ulp. Variable <code>n</code> is an integer and all the other variables are
single-precision floating-point numbers.</para>

<programlisting language="c">r2 = -n * l2;
r = r1 + r2;
q = r * r * (a1 + r * a2);
p = r1 + (r2 + q);
s = s1 + s2;
e = s1 + (s2 + s * p);</programlisting>

<para>Let us note <code>R</code> the computed reduced argument and
<code>S</code> the stored value of the ideal constant <code>S0</code>. There
are 32 such constants. For the sake of simplicity, we only consider the
second constant: <texinline>2^{\frac{1}{32}}</texinline>. <code>E</code> is
the value of the expression <code>e</code> computed with an infinitely
precise arithmetic. <code>Z</code> is the absolute error between the
polynomial <texinline>x + a_1 \cdot x^2 + a_2 \cdot x^3</texinline> and
<texinline>\exp(x) - 1</texinline> for <texinline>|x| \le \frac{\log 2}{64}
</texinline>.</para>

<para>Gappa is unable to bound the expressions. This is not surprising
for <code>e - E0</code>, since the tool is missing some of the implicit
transformations hidden in the implementation. As for <code>e</code>
itself, Gappa is missing the range of <code>r1</code>. Since Gappa has
access to the ranges of <code>R</code> and <code>r2</code>, this issue can
be solved by adding the hint: <code>r1 -&gt; R - r2</code>.</para>

<para>Please note the way <code>Z</code> is introduced. Its definition is
backward: <code>Z</code> is a real number such that <code>E0</code> is the
product of <code>S0</code> and the exponential of <code>R0</code>. It makes for
clearer definitions and it avoids having to deal with divisions.</para>

<para>Now to <code>e - E0</code>. We compute this error by splitting it between
a pure rounding error <code>e - E</code> and another term which combines
discretization and truncation errors. This term is <code>E - E0</code>.
Unfortunately, Gappa is unable to compute tight bounds for this term since the
syntactic structures of its sub-terms do not match.</para>

<para>So we introduce a new expression <code>Er</code> equal to <code>E</code>
yet matching the structure of <code>E0</code>. Since <code>Z</code> has no
equivalent term in <code>E</code>, we insert an artificial term <code>0</code>
in the corresponding place in <code>Er</code>.</para>

Er = S * (1 + R + a1 * R * R + a2 * R * R * R + 0);
