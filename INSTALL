Prerequisites:

You will need to have these libraries in order to build Gappa: 

  GMP    http://www.swox.com/gmp/
  MPFR   http://www.mpfr.org/
  Boost  http://www.boost.org/

The Boost libraries do not have to be built: no object library is used.

You will also need to have Flex and Bison.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the CVS repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
CVS, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Compiling:

The usual

  $ ./configure
  $ make

will build Gappa. You may have to set the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS in order
for the configure script to correctly find the various libraries.
