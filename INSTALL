Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to have these libraries in order to build Gappa: 

  GMP    http://www.swox.com/gmp/
  MPFR   http://www.mpfr.org/
  Boost  http://www.boost.org/

The Boost libraries do not have to be built: Gappa uses only header libraries.

You will also need to have Flex and Bison.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the CVS repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
CVS, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.8).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && make

But due to Murphy's Law, it will most probably fail. If it does, look at the
following guidelines. First, the ./configure script may need a few environment
variables. CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS will be used to locate the libraries if they
are not in standard locations. CXX and CXXFLAGS define the compiler and its
compilation flags. Bloated example:

  $ ./configure "CXX=distcc g++" "CXXFLAGS=-O3" "CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include" "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib"

If everything went well, the script should say it created the Makefile. So
you just have to launch "make" for Gappa to be compiled. As for the
installation, none is needed: src/gappa is a standalone executable file. But
if you want to install it no matter what, this is standard ./configure black
magic, so I will not explain any further and assume you know what you are
doing. You can always rely on './configure --help' for additional information.

As a last tip, think about './config.status -V' if you already installed an
older version of Gappa. The output of this script will give you the command-
line you used the last time you ran ./configure in its directory.


Documentation
-------------

The source of the online documentation is located in the doc directory. It
may be generated by running 'make html-doc' in this directory. You will need
xsltproc and dvi2bitmap. Their locations can be provided by ./configure magic.
