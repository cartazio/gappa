Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to have these libraries in order to build Gappa: 

  GMP    http://www.swox.com/gmp/
  MPFR   http://www.mpfr.org/
  Boost  http://www.boost.org/

Note that the Boost libraries do not have to be built, as Gappa depends
only on library headers.

You will also need to have Flex and Bison.

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the git repository though. Consequently, if you are building from
git, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59).


Configuring, compiling and installing
-------------------------------------

Ideally, you should just have to type:

  $ ./configure && ./remake

But due to Murphy's Law, it will most probably fail. If it does, look at the
following guidelines. First, the ./configure script may need a few environment
variables. CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS will be used to locate the libraries if they
are not in standard locations. CXX and CXXFLAGS define the compiler and its
compilation flags. Bloated example:

  $ ./configure "CXX=distcc g++" "CXXFLAGS=-O3" "CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include" "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib"

If everything went well, the script should say it created the Makefile. So
you just have to launch ./remake for Gappa to be compiled. As for the
installation, none is needed: src/gappa is a standalone executable file. But
if you still want to install it, './remake install' will do the job. As for
the install location, this is standard ./configure black magic, so I will
not explain any further and assume you know what you are doing. You can
always rely on './configure --help' for additional information.

As a last tip, think about './config.status -V' if you already installed an
older version of Gappa. The output of this script will give you the command-
line you used the last time you ran ./configure in its directory.


Documentation
-------------

The online documentation may be generated by './remake doc/html/index.html'.
You will need xsltproc and dblatex. Their locations can be provided by
./configure magic.
