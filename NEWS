Version 0.5.0:
 * whole engine
   - generalized rounding modes as complete functions
   - generalized functions with rounding theorems
 * syntax
   - splitted variables and functions

Version 0.4.10:
 * proof graph
   - changed the node hypotheses to be graph hypotheses

Version 0.4.9:
 * numbers and arithmetic
   - separated number handling from special arithmetic
