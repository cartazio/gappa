Version 0.4.9:
 * numbers and arithmetic
   - separated number handling from special arithmetic
   - added "relative", a format for handling varying precision rounding
 * formulas
   - implemented absolute value
 * fact database
   - made relative error depends on absolute value of the range
 * proof graph
   - fixed a bug related to the clean-up of the last graph of a dichotomy
   - strenghtened the role of modus nodes

Version 0.4.8:
 * fact database
   - tightened intervals for "a + b + a * b"
   - discarded multiple occurrences of the same term in the rewriting rules
   - cleaned up rewriting rules

Version 0.4.7:
 * hint parser
   - sped up verification

Version 0.4.6:
 * floating-point numbers
   - disabled relative error for subnormal numbers (potentially disruptive)
 * homogen numbers
   - cleaned up
   - added non-homogen double rounded format
 * hint parser
   - added pseudo-support for quotient in hint
 * parser
   - added support for C99 hexadecimal floating-point format
 * proof graph
   - replaced useless empty intersections by contradiction proofs

Version 0.4.5:
 * proof graph
   - reworked modus ponens creation to fix an assertion failure in lemma invokation
 * fact database
   - added conditional rules (potentially disruptive)
 * homogen numbers
   - split roundings between initialization and computation
 * Coq backend
   - implemented union
