Description: Verification tool for floating-point programs
 Gappa is a tool intended to help verifying and formally proving
 properties on numerical programs dealing with floating-point or
 fixed-point arithmetic. It has been used to write robust floating-point
 filters for CGAL and it is used to certify elementary functions in
 CRlibm. While Gappa is intended to be used directly, it can also act as
 a backend prover for the Why software verification plateform or as an
 automatic tactic for the Coq proof assistant.
